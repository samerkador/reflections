git status give state of the last commit that done and the untaraking file wich not commit at all not even single time.

_How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?


staging area where we can put only file after git add where here we are preaper the file to be commited and this thing allow us to commit more than one file per commit if they are rely tide to each other logiclay it will make sense

working area contain file that are not commited nither add to staging area

repository have the comiited file only wich have an id msg and so on...
